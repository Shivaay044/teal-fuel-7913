          configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
          eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be eligible
          to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in value may
          be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added to an Apple
          Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a qualifying
          device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales
          tax may be assessed on full value of a new device purchase. In-store
          trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local law may
          require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all
          stores, and may vary between in-store and online trade-in. Some stores
          may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade-in partners
          reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of any trade-in
          transaction for any reason. More details are available from Appleâ€™s
          trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible devices.
          Restrictions and limitations may apply.
